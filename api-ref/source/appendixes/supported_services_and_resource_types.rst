Supported Services and Resource Types
=====================================

You can obtain the cloud services (**provider**) and resource types (**type**) supported by Config in either of the following ways:

-  Calling APIs

   You can call the API for :ref:`listing cloud services <rms_04_0102>` to query cloud services, resources, and regions supported by Config. The **provider** field indicates the cloud service name, and the **name** field in **resource_types** indicates the resource type name.

-  Management console

   To view services and resources supported by Config, sign in to the console and click **Supported Services and Regions** in **Resource List** page. You can view related information in the **Resource Type** column of the list.
