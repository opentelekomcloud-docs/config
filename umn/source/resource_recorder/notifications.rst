Notifications
=============

Notifications of your resource changes will be sent to the SMN topic subscribers after you enable the resource recorder and configure the SMN topic. If no topics are available, you need to create a topic, add subscriptions to the topic, and request confirmation for the subscriptions.

For details, see `Simple Message Notification User Guide <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/simple-message-notification/umn/overview/simple_message_notification.html>`__.

Config sends notifications when:

-  Resources are created, modified, or deleted.
-  Resource relationships change.
-  Resource change notifications are saved.
-  Resource snapshots are saved.

For details about example code for resource change notifications, see :ref:`Notification Models <rms_06_0300>`.
