Viewing Resource Relationships
==============================

Scenarios
---------

Config allows you to view resource relationships. A resource relationship may be described as that an EVS disk is attached to an ECS or an ECS is deployed in a VPC. Config only provides relationships of supported resources. For more details, see :ref:`Relationships with Supported Resources <rms_01_0018>`.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner. Under **Management & Deployment**, click **Config**.

#. On the **Resource List** page, click the name of a target resource.

#. Click the **Associated Resources** tab.

   Hover over the name of an associated resource to view resource information and resource relationships.

   For each service, you can filter resources by resource ID or resource name.
